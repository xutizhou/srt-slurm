# Example cluster configuration (srtslurm.yaml)

# Discovery: srtctl searches cwd and up to 2 parent directories.
# For deep directory structures, set SRTSLURM_CONFIG in your shell:

# SLURM directive compatibility
# Set to false if your cluster doesn't support --gpus-per-node
use_gpus_per_node_directive: true  # Default: true
# Set to false if your cluster doesn't support --segment for segment-based scheduling
use_segment_sbatch_directive: true  # Default: true
# Set to true if your cluster requires --exclusive to be set.

# AI-powered failure analysis (optional)
# When enabled, Claude Code CLI analyzes benchmark failures and writes ai_analysis.md
# Uses OpenRouter for authentication (works well in headless/automated environments)
# See: https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/guides/claude-code-integration
# ai_analysis:
#   enabled: true
#   
#   # Authentication (required - can also use env vars OPENROUTER_API_KEY / GH_TOKEN)
#   openrouter_api_key: "sk-or-v1-..."
#   gh_token: "ghp_..."
#   
#   # GitHub repos to search for related PRs when analyzing failures
#   repos_to_search:
#     - sgl-project/sglang
#     - ai-dynamo/dynamo
#   pr_search_days: 14
#   
#   # Custom prompt template (optional - uses sensible default if omitted)
#   # Available variables: {log_dir}, {repos}, {pr_days}

#   #   You are analyzing benchmark failure logs for an LLM serving system.
#   #   ...

# Usage:
# In your job config, you can now use:
#   model:
#     path: "deepseek-r1"         # Resolves to /shared/models/deepseek/DeepSeek-R1
#     container: "sglang-fp4"     # Resolves to /shared/containers/sglang-fp4.sqsh
#
# And you can omit SLURM fields:
#   slurm:
#     time_limit: "02:00:00"      # account and partition filled from defaults
